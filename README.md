50+ Java Interview Questions - Trying with best approach

If you're a QA Engineer, who is looking to switch or is starting with coding for the sake of learning Test Automation
this is for you.

Like many of my fellow QA's out there, I feel that I'm not up to the mark when it comes to Programming.
And programming is a skill, which keeps getting better the more you practice it - just like Maths.

So, I created a repo, where I keep adding the programming questions that I keep solving in my free time.

## Why Java?

It seems to be the language of choice for a majority of the folks out there in QA automation space. Even though my
first preference was Python ( and still is), I think more people will relate to it since they've worked or are thinking
of working with Java. It's an evergreen language.

## Folders

Currently this as following folders -
1. Arrays
2. Hashmap
3. Others
4. Sorting
5. Strings
6. Stacks
7. Search

The folder name should be a general indication of which programs go to which folders and this will keep changing as
I add more programs to this repo.

Feel free to fork it, copy it, create a branch and add more programming questions and create a PR. I'll merge.
